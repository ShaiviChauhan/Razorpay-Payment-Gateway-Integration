        <h1>CHARITY IS HOPE</h1>  
    <p> We provide a support structure for people affected by death or traumatic experiences from a fire or RTC. We are here to assist those in need.<br>

       <br> We work in partnership with professional agencies, community or voluntary networks and other organisations throughout the area to assist the beneficiaries of the charity.<br>
        
        <br>We provide information through seminars, conferences and training events, which aim to address the emotional trauma suffered by the deceased’s loved ones.
